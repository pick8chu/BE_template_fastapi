# note

- prefix "test_" is required for pytest to retreat all the test files.
- "pytest (folder_name)" would start a test in that folder
- \_\_init\_\_.py file on directory is necessary to indicate the folders are modules.

```
// example
pytest tests
```

- tests will be conducted only to the funtions that have "test_" as prefix.
